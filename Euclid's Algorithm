Euclid's Algorithm
 to find GCD of two positive numbers.
 consider two positive integers:
   m, n such that m>n
   
   step 1. Divide m by n and r = remainder
   step 2. if r=0
            r = n ; //ends algorithm.
           else
             m = n;
             n = r;
             go back to step 1 (recursive) // untill r = 0.
